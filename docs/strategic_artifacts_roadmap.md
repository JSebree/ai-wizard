# Strategic Artifacts Roadmap: Next Steps

**Goal:** Strengthen the SceneMe portfolio for (1) Engineering Leadership roles and (2) Investment/Partnership opportunities.

## 1. High-Impact Visuals (The "At a Glance" Win)
*Humans process visuals 60,000x faster than text. These are critical for Pitch Decks and Portfolio headers.*

### A. System Architecture Diagram (Mermaid.js)
*   **Purpose:** Prove Engineering Seniority & "AI-Native" Efficiency.
*   **Audience:** CTOs, Lead Engineers.
*   **Narrative Alignment:** Visualizing the **"Cyborg Team" Architecture**. Show how a small backend (Node/BullMQ) leverages massive external compute (n8n/RunPod) to do the work of 50 people.
*   **Content:**
    *   `UI (Intent)` -> `API Gateway` -> `BullMQ (Redis)` -> `Director Engine`.
    *   `Director` fan-out -> `n8n/RunPod` (The "AI Workforce").
    *   `Composition` -> `S3/Supabase`.

### B. The "Orchestration Layer" Comparison Chart
*   **Purpose:** Market Differentiation ("The Innovator's Dilemma").
*   **Audience:** Investors.
*   **Narrative Alignment:** **"Intent vs. Tools"**. Contrast the messy "Spaghetti" of manual tools against the clean "Stack" of SceneMe.
*   **Content:** A "Layer Cake" diagram showing:
    *   *Bottom:* Commodity Models (Luma, Sora, ElevenLabs).
    *   *Middle:* **SceneMe (The OS: Orchestration, IP, Consistency).**
    *   *Top:* High-Value Assets (Episodes, Ads).

## 2. Deep-Dive Documentation (The "Trust Builder")

### A. "Scaling SceneMe" Technical Roadmap
*   **Purpose:** Show foresight. "I know how to spend your money wisely."
*   **Content:**
    *   **Phase 1 (Now):** Hybrid Stability. (The "Lean Startup" Phase).
    *   **Phase 2 (Growth):** Full Async Pipeline. GPU Auto-scaling. (The "Scale" Phase).
    *   **Phase 3 (Dominance):** Multi-tenant isolation. Enterprise SSO.

### B. "The Creator's Workflow" (User Journey)
*   **Purpose:** Product Vision.
*   **Narrative Alignment:** **"From Editor to Director"**.
*   **Content:** A narrative comparison:
    *   *The Old Way (Adobe):* 4 hours. Import clips, sync audio, color grade.
    *   *The SceneMe Way (Intent):* 2 minutes. Type concept, review "Dailies," Publish.
    *   *Message:* We sell Time and Story, not Tools.

## 3. The "Secret Weapon" Artifacts

### A. The "Prompt Algorithms" Whitepaper (Lite)
*   **Purpose:** AI Expertise.
*   **Content:** A breakdown of the **"Hallucination Drift" Solution**.
*   **Why:** Proves that "Narrative Consistency" isn't magic, it's engineering.

### B. "Model Evaluation" Matrix
*   **Purpose:** Data-driven decision making (Model Agnosticism).
*   **Content:** A comparison table of why we chose LTX vs. SVD vs. Runway (Cost/Speed/Quality trade-offs).
*   **Message:** "We aren't married to a model. We date the winner."

## Recommendation
I recommend priority execution on **1.A (System Diagram)** next. It is the strongest visual proof of your "AI-Native" architectural philosophy.
