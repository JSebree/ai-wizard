## RELEVANT WORK EXPERIENCE

**SceneMe (Stealth AI Startup)** | Remote  
**Lead Creative AI Engineer / Founder** | *April 2024 – Present*

*Architecting the "Operating System" for Generative Narrative Video. Building a cloud-native platform that orchestrates 11+ distinct AI models to generate broadcast-ready episodic content.*

*   **AI System Architecture:** Designed a decoupled **Async Job Queue architecture** (Node.js, BullMQ, Redis) to manage long-running GPU inference tasks (40m+) across distributed serverless workers, solving the "timeout problem" inherent in generative media.
*   **Ensemble Engineering:** Built a "Director" agent that autonomously orchestrates specialized SOTA models (LTX Video, Qwen VL, ElevenLabs, Hunyuan Audio) into a cohesive narrative pipeline, achieving a **100x reduction in active production time**.
*   **Pipeline Automation:** Leveraged **n8n** as a "Low-Code API Gateway" to abstract complex model providers, enabling rapid hot-swapping of under-the-hood models (e.g., LTX to Sora) without frontend refactors.
*   **Data Consistency:** Developed a "Master Keyframe" context injection system to eliminate generic hallucinations, ensuring character and scene consistency across multi-shot sequences.

**Intuit** | Remote  
**Senior Product Analyst** | *March 2022 – April 2024*

*Drove product strategy and data engineering initiatives for high-volume financial products (QuickBooks ecosystem).*

*   **Data Pipeline Engineering:** Designed and maintained robust ETL pipelines using **SQL** and internal orchestration tools to process petabyte-scale clickstream data, ensuring high-availability telemetry for product teams.
*   **Experimentation Platform:** Engineered the tracking schemas and data structures for large-scale A/B tests, enabling precise measurement of feature impact across millions of users.
*   **Automated Insights:** Developed automated custom dashboard reporting workflows that reduced manual analyst hours by **30%**, allowing the team to focus on strategic "Why" questions rather than "What" reporting.
*   **Cross-Functional Leadership:** Acted as the technical bridge between Data Engineering, Product Management, and Engineering, translating complex business requirements into precise data specifications.
