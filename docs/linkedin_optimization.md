# LinkedIn Optimization Strategy: The "Creative AI Architect"

**Goal:** Position Jerick Sebree not just as a "Developer," but as a **Product-Minded Systems Architect** capable of orchestrating complex AI ensembles.

## 1. The Headline (The "Hook")
*Recruiters search for keywords. Leaders look for titles.*

**Recommended Option:**
> **Lead Creative AI Engineer | Building Autonomous Narrative Engines (Node, n8n, LTX) | Architect of SceneMe**

**Why this works:**
*   **"Lead Creative AI":** Defines the niche immediately.
*   **"Autonomous Narrative Engines":** Sounds significantly more expensive/senior than "Video App."
*   **"Node, n8n, LTX":** Signals full-stack + low-code + SOTA model experience in 3 words.

---

## 2. The "About" Section (The "Story")
*This is your elevator pitch. It needs to solve the "So What?"*

**Draft:**

> I build systems that turn high-level human intent into production-grade AI assets.
>
> Currently, I am the **Lead Architect of SceneMe**, an autonomous orchestration platform that replaces the manual video editing workflow with an intelligent "Director" agent.
>
> **The Problem:** Generative AI is fragmented. You have 5 tools for video, 3 for audio, and 0 for storytelling.
> **My Solution:** I architected a **Hybrid "Cyborg" Pipeline** that orchestrates an ensemble of **11 SOTA models** (LTX, Qwen, ElevenLabs, etc.) into a cohesive narrative engine.
>
> **Core Technical Achievements:**
> *   **System Design:** Built a decoupled **Async Job Queue architecture** (BullMQ/Redis) to manage long-running GPU inference tasks (40m+) without blocking the user experience.
> *   **Model Agnosticism:** Engineered a plug-and-play backend that abstracts model providers, allowing us to hot-swap between LTX and Sora in <24 hours.
> *   **Workflow Automation:** Leveraged **n8n** as a "Low-Code API Gateway," enabling a lean team to manage enterprise-grade complexity.
>
> I am passionate about **"Time Arbitrage"**—building tools where a human spends 2 minutes directing, and the machine spends 40 minutes rendering.
>
> **Tech Stack:** TypeScript, Node.js, React, Python, Docker, PostgreSQL, Redis, n8n.

## 3. The "Experience" Section (The "Proof")

### Role: Founder & Lead Engineer
**Company:** SceneMe (Stealth / AI startup)
**Dates:** [Start Date] – Present

**Description:**
Building the "Operating System" for Generative Narrative Video. Architected a cloud-native platform that orchestrates **11+ distinct AI models** to generate broadcast-ready episodic content.

*   **Architected a Hybrid "Ensemble" Engine:** Designed a Node.js "Director" that coordinates specialized agents for Video (LTX), Audio (Hunyuan), and 3D Context (WorldGen), achieving a **100x reduction in active user time**.
*   **Solved "The Timeout Problem":** Implemented a robust **Asynchronous Job Queue (BullMQ)** system to handle long-running generation tasks (20–40 mins) that exceed standard serverless limits.
*   **Engineered for IP Consistency:** Developed a "Master Keyframe" context injection system that eliminates "Hallucination Drift," allowing for consistent characters across multiple generated shots.
*   **Operational Efficiency:** Utilized **n8n** for "NoOps" model orchestration, enabling a single engineer to manage a pipeline complexity typically requiring a 5-person ML Ops team.
*   **Professional Integration:** Built **EDL (Edit Decision List)** export functionality, bridging the gap between AI generation and professional tools like Adobe Premiere.
