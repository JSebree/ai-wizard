# SceneMe: Technology & Product Brief

**The "Operating System" for Generative Narrative**
*Turning stochastic clips into valuable IP.*

---

## 1. The Market Thesis: The "Innovator's Dilemma"
The AI Video market is splitting into two camps: **The Model Builders** (Sora, LTX) and **The Tool Builders** (Adobe, CapCut).
*   **The Trap:** Incumbents like Adobe are trapped by their own success. They view AI as an *incremental feature*—a "Generate" button inside a manual timeline—because their business model depends on selling complex tools to experts.
*   **The SceneMe Advantage:** We are **Intent-First**. We didn't build an editor; we built a Director. By embedding intent at the foundation, we bypass the "Timeline Paradigm" entirely, unlocking a market of millions who want *stories* but will never learn Premiere Pro.

## 2. The Solution: An Autonomous Narrative Engine
SceneMe replaces the current fragmented workflow (Prompt -> Generate Clip -> Output -> Edit) with a single intelligent pipeline that orchestrates a **Massive Ensemble** of 11+ specialized models:

| Task | Model / Engine | Why? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Video Gen** | **LTX-2** | Best-in-class temporal coherence. |
| **Keyframes** | **Qwen Image 2512** | Superior composition & prompt adherence. |
| **Editing** | **Qwen Edit 2511** | Precise in-painting for character consistency. |
| **Settings** | **WorldGen** | 3D-aware background generation. |
| **Lipsync** | **InfiniteTalk** | Millisecond-perfect visual phonemes. |
| **Voice** | **Higgs Audio V2** | Emotional TTS. |
| **Conversion** | **SeedVC** | Speech-to-Speech acting transfer. |
| **Reshooting** | **InfCam** | Camera trajectory control. |
| **Score** | **Ace Step** | Tempo-synced music generation. |
| **SFX** | **Hunyuan Foley** | Audio-visual correlated sound effects. |
| **Polish** | **Real-ESRGAN** | 4K Upscaling. |

**The Workflow:** The Engine routes a user's intent (*"A 60s noir film"*) through this complex dependency graph automatically.

## 3. The Moat: The "Episodic Engine"
Most AI tools are designed for "Viral One-Offs." SceneMe is built for **Reproducible IP**.

### A. Integrated Asset Pipeline (Studio-to-Express)
We bridge the gap between "Manual Creation" and "Automated Scale":
*   **The Character Studio:** A user designs a specific Brand Ambassador (e.g., "Agent Smith").
*   **The Express Engine:** "Agent Smith" is saved as a normalized entity. The engine can now generate *thousands* of unique videos starring Agent Smith.

### B. "Show Templates" (Format-as-a-Service)
We unlocked the ability to productize "Formats."
*   **The Recipe:** Users define a "Show Bible".
*   **The Scale:** To make Episode 2, the user just types a new topic key. The AI respects the Bible perfectly.

## 4. Technology Strategy: "Anti-Fragile" Architecture

### A. Model Agnostic Infrastructure (The Ensemble)
We are built to survive the AI Wars.
*   **Plug-and-Play:** Our backend abstracts the "Provider." We swap models like batteries.
*   **Arbitrage:** We route tasks to the most cost-effective model for the specific shot.

### B. Narrative Consistency Algorithms
We solved "Hallucination Drift."
*   **Tech:** Our "Master Keyframe" context system ensures the protagonist doesn't change appearance between shots. The Director Engine maintains a persistent state of the "World," enabling long-form content vs. disjointed clips.

## 5. Competitive Landscape

| Feature | **GenAI Models** (Runway) | **Editors** (CapCut) | **SceneMe** (The Director) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Philosophy** | "Better Camera" | "Better Tools" | **"Better Stories"** |
| **Models** | Single (Propritary) | None | **Ensemble (11+ SOTA)** |
| **Consistency** | Low (Random seed) | Manual | **High (State Engine)** |
| **Monetization** | Selling Credits | Selling Seats | **Selling IP/Episodes** |

## 6. Business Vision
*   **Now (v0.7.1):** The "Adobe for AI." A hybrid tool for creators.
*   **Next:** "Multi-Agent Studios." Collaborative AI agents.
*   **Future:** The **"Netflix of Generated Content."** A platform where users not only create but consume personalized, infinite episodic content.
