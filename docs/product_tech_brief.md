# SceneMe: Technology & Product Brief

**The "Operating System" for Generative Narrative**
*Turning stochastic clips into valuable IP.*

---

## 1. The Market Thesis: The "Innovator's Dilemma"
The AI Video market is splitting into two camps: **The Model Builders** (Sora, LTX) and **The Tool Builders** (Adobe, CapCut).
*   **The Trap:** Incumbents like Adobe are trapped by their own success. They view AI as an *incremental feature*—a "Generate" button inside a manual timeline—because their business model depends on selling complex tools to experts.
*   **The SceneMe Advantage:** We are **Intent-First**. We didn't build an editor; we built a Director. By embedding intent at the foundation, we bypass the "Timeline Paradigm" entirely, unlocking a market of millions who want *stories* but will never learn Premiere Pro.

## 2. The Solution: An Autonomous Narrative Engine
SceneMe replaces the current fragmented workflow (Prompt -> Generate Clip -> Download -> Edit -> Voiceover -> Sync) with a single intelligent pipeline.

**"Express Mode" Workflow:**
1.  **Intent:** User inputs a high-level goal (e.g., *"A 30s ad for a luxury coffee brand, noir style"*).
2.  **Direction:** The Engine writes the script, selects the "Cast" (Voice/Face), and acts as the Director.
3.  **Production:** It dispatches parallel tasks to the best-in-class models (LTX for video, ElevenLabs for voice).
4.  **Assembly:** It stitches audio, video, and captions with millisecond-perfect timing.
**Result:** A publish-ready video in < 2 Minutes.

## 3. The Moat: The "Episodic Engine"
Most AI tools are designed for "Viral One-Offs." SceneMe is built for **Reproducible IP**.

### A. Integrated Asset Pipeline (Studio-to-Express)
We bridge the gap between "Manual Creation" and "Automated Scale":
*   **The Character Studio:** A user designs a specific Brand Ambassador (e.g., "Agent Smith").
*   **The Express Engine:** "Agent Smith" is saved as a normalized entity (Face Embeddings + Voice Clone). The engine can now generate *thousands* of unique videos starring Agent Smith.
*   **Value:** This solves the huge "Consistency Problem" for brands. They don't want a random AI face; they want *their* face.

### B. "Show Templates" (Format-as-a-Service)
We unlocked the ability to productize "Formats."
*   **The Recipe:** Users define a "Show Bible" (e.g., *Educational, Upbeat, Host: Sarah, 60s*).
*   **The Scale:** To make Episode 2, the user just types a new topic key. The AI respects the Bible perfectly.
*   **Market:** Ideal for Content Farms, News Agencies, and Educational Platforms needing high-volume, high-quality consistency.

## 4. Technology Strategy: "Anti-Fragile" Architecture

### A. Model Agnostic Infrastructure
We are built to survive the AI Wars.
*   **Plug-and-Play:** Our backend abstracts the "Provider." We swap models like batteries.
    *   *Today:* LTX + ElevenLabs.
    *   *Tomorrow:* Sora + OpenAI Voice.
*   **Arbitrage:** We route tasks to the most cost-effective model for the specific shot (e.g., use a cheaper model for B-Roll, expensive model for Hero Shots), optimizing margins.

### B. Narrative Consistency Algorithms
We solved "Hallucination Drift."
*   **Tech:** Our "Master Keyframe" context system ensures the protagonist doesn't change appearance between shots. The Director Engine maintains a persistent state of the "World," enabling long-form content vs. disjointed clips.

## 5. Competitive Landscape

| Feature | **GenAI Models** (Runway, Sora) | **Editors** (CapCut, Premiere) | **SceneMe** (The Director) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Philosophy** | "Better Camera" | "Better Tools" | **"Better Stories"** |
| **Output** | Raw Clips (3-5s) | Final Video | **Final Narrative Video** |
| **User Input** | Visual Prompt | Manual Editing | **High-Level Intent** |
| **Consistency** | Low (Random seed) | Manual | **High (State Engine)** |
| **Monetization** | Selling Credits | Selling Seats | **Selling IP/Episodes** |

## 6. Business Vision
*   **Now (v0.7.1):** The "Adobe for AI." A hybrid tool for creators.
*   **Next:** "Multi-Agent Studios." Collaborative AI agents (Scriptwriter, Cinematographer) working in tandem.
*   **Future:** The **"Netflix of Generated Content."** A platform where users not only create but consume personalized, infinite episodic content.
